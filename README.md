# Joystick_Interface

Laboratory project during the “Digital Electronics Systems Design” master’s degree course. 
The aim of the project was to use the JSTK2 Pmod from Digilent to play the game “Spaceshooter” on our computer, using a Basys 3 board, equipped with an Artix 7 FPGA, to process and exchange data between the PC and the joystick. 
To this purpose, made a block design in Vivado (as shown in the figure), and write the VHDL code of every block. Particular attention was posed in the optimization of resource usage and in the correctness
of protocols, through the hardware debugger. 
At the end of the project, we were able to play the “spaceshoother” game with the joystick we programmed with. The controller featured led notifications of the game status, Y-X axis movement control, shooting control and game pause control.
